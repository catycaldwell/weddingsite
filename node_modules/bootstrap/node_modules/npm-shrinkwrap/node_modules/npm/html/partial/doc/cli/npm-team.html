</code></pre><h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Used to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships. Does not
handle permissions for packages.</p>
<p>Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belond to
when operating on them, separated by a colon (<code>:</code>). That is, if you have a
<code>developers</code> team on a <code>foo</code> organization, you must always refer to that team as
<code>developers:foo</code> in these commands.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>create / destroy:
Create a new team, or destroy an existing one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>add / rm:
Add a user to an existing team, or remove a user from a team they belong to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ls:
If performed on an organization name, will return a list of existing teams
under that organization. If performed on a team, it will instead return a list
of all users belonging to that particular team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details">DETAILS</h2>
<p><code>npm team</code> always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from
the command line using <code>--registry=&lt;registry url&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In order to create teams and manage team membership, you must be a <em>team admin</em>
under the given organization. Listing teams and team memberships may be done by
any member of the organizations.</p>
<p>Organization creation and management of team admins and <em>organization</em> members
is done through the website, not the npm CLI.</p>
<p>To use teams to manage permissions on packages belonging to your organization,
use the <code>npm access</code> command to grant or revoke the appropriate permissions.</p>
